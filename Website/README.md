# Blocks Media Website

This is the official website for Blocks Media, a creative agency specializing in NFT collections, website design, and community games.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: Main landing page.
-   `css/`: Stylesheets (`style.css`, `chatbot.css`).
-   `js/`: JavaScript files.
    -   `main.js`: Main logic for animations, sliders, and interactions.
    -   `chatbot.js`: Logic for the AI chatbot.
    -   `three-bg.js`: Three.js background animation.
-   `nft1/`: Assets for the NFT collection slider.
-   `websample/`: Sample website projects.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Open `index.html`** in a modern web browser.
    -   For the best experience, use a local development server (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to ensure all assets and scripts load correctly without CORS issues.

## Important Notes

-   **Chatbot**: The chatbot functionality currently relies on a client-side API key. For production use, this should be moved to a secure backend.
-   **Contact Form**: The contact form is configured to use Formspree. Ensure the form ID is correct before deploying.
